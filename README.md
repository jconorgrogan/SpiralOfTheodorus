# Spiral Of Theodorus

HTML visualizations of the Spiral of Theodorus in a few different cuts. I believe that this spiral is absolutely critical in number theory (and underappreciated by the mathematical community) and I hope this code helps bring more attention to it! I will add on to this, including 3d visualizations which are normalized in the y axis by the angle of each triangle (as a proxy for "time")
